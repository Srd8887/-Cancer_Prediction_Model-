# 🧬 Cancer Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using diagnostic measurements.  
This project demonstrates **data preprocessing, feature analysis, model building, and evaluation** — applying machine learning to a real-world healthcare problem.

## 📂 Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early and accurate detection can save lives.  
In this project, I:
- Explored and cleaned the dataset using **pandas**
- Visualized feature patterns with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Built and evaluated ML models using **scikit-learn**
- Assessed performance with **ROC Curve** and **AUC**
